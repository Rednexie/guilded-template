Perma.db is a node.js database management library, uses better-sqlite3 under the hood. You use both SQL and No-SQL systems inside one module. Perma.db comes with some advantages, such as:

Auto-vacuum database: When the parameter `minimize` is true, perma.db vacuums your database everytime you import the module.

"Better" sqlite integration: You will be able to use the functions and advantages of sqlite3 easier.

Database caching: perma.db has an option to cache the database, making it both consistent and as fast as redis.

# Single database usage: You don't always have to import PermaDB class to create a new PermaDB database, you can just import the permadb module to use it inside a single database.

Backup feature: You can backup your database using the built in function.
